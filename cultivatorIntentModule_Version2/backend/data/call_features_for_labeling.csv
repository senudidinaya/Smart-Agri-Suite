clip_0635,of time. Why has the agriculture sector come to a standstill?,,
clip_0636,this state of why is it a sleeping giant? How can we wake it up?,,
clip_0637,One of the features is very low land and labour productivity.,,
clip_0638,One of the reasons is quite obvious because it's a small scale of operations,,
clip_0639,"When you have got one or less, I don't think you can make an economy.",,
clip_0640,Go of running agriculture Profitably or successfully then we have,,
clip_0641,"improper land use and resulting from that, improper agronomy and agricultural.",,
clip_0642,"Then as I explained earlier, small size of arm holding",,
clip_0643,"lead to low farm family income due to small land ownership. Now, for example,",,
clip_0644,"For example, a major economic crop in Sri Lanka is a team...",,
clip_0645,"The smallholder sector, right, they are self-supportive, they are not depending on...",,
clip_0646,"government, the tea industry runs on its own, the smallholder sector with 400",,
clip_0647,"50,000 operators, the average landholding size is 59 to 60 percent.",,
clip_0648,So with 59 to 60 perches they make their living and of course 30...,,
clip_0649,only two acres. Anyone involved in pedi knows that with two acres you cannot,,

clip_0656,"issues of land, land degradation comes under issues, high labour component cost.",,

clip_0658,of the low use of technology and appropriate agricultural practices.,,
clip_0659,labor cost component is fairly high compared to the other industries and other countries.,,
clip_0660,And another important thing is insecurity of tenure and ownership terms.,,
clip_0661,"Even in commercial agriculture, an example is the plantation sector.",,
clip_0662,We are a long-term crop and we have uncertainties about the tenure. We have 20 years,,
clip_0663,"to go before the lease runs out. Up to now, there is no guarantee or...",,
clip_0664,There is no indication that the lease should be continued. So no investor.,,
clip_0665,normally a rubber crop takes 30 years and a tea crop about 50 years,,
clip_0666,So there should be some indication of continuity if investors are going to invest in land.,,
clip_0667,"So the supplies in the small scale as well, then I already discussed",,
clip_0668,"even if you take out major commercial crops like tea, which are",,
clip_0669,"In Sri Lanka, the state is about 200 to 250 hectares on average.",,
clip_0670,compared to the better tea economies like in Kenya which is about 1000 hectares.,,
clip_0671,"So these diseconomies of scale, at a certain point, brings huge disadvantages.",,
clip_0672,but we have met in Sri Lanka.,,
clip_0673,and we produce different types of diverse tea.,,
clip_0674,"keep ahead of the competition. Then low use of technology, innovation.",,
clip_0675,and the small size and lack of capital means low mechanisation and automation in agriculture.,,
